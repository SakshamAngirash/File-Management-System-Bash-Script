# File Management System Bash-Script
 In today's digital age, the management of electronic files is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. The amount of digital data we generate and store has grown exponentially, making it increasingly difficult to organise, locate, and manage files efficiently. This is where a file management system comes in.  A file management system is a software solution that helps users organise and manage their digital files effectively. It provides a central location for storing and accessing files.  The aim of this project is to design and develop a file management system that meets the needs of basic file management systems.This project aims to give a better understanding of how and what operation can be performed on files.
